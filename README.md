A more simpler phone number field, widget, and formatter for Drupal 7.

It currently assumes that the field could be collecting an International or US number, and does decent-enough validation on the US-type number, and very little on the international, since there are many different formats of international phone numbers and frankly I didn't care to validate them all.
